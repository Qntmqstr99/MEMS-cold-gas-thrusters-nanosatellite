## Description

This project explores the development and utilization of MEMS (micro-electromechanical systems) cold gas thrusters for nanosatellites, particularly focusing on active orbital control mechanisms. The goal is to design and implement a propulsion system suitable for CubeSat-class nanosatellites, enabling precise maneuvers and orbital adjustments.

## Summary

This paper discusses the development and implementation of a propulsion system using MEMS (micro-electromechanical systems) cold gas thrusters for nanosatellites, specifically targeting CubeSat class satellites. It focuses on the following key aspects:

**Design and Specifications:** The paper outlines the design of a propulsion module tailored for a 2-unit CubeSat. The module measures 10cm x 10cm x 30cm and weighs 220g. It includes a propulsion tank that holds 60g of butane at a pressure of 2 to 5 bar.

**Propulsion Capabilities:** The propulsion system can achieve a delta-V (change in velocity) of up to 15m/s for a nanosatellite weighing 2.66kg. This capability is significant for maneuvering and maintaining the satellite's orbit in a 300km low Earth orbit (LEO).

**Thruster Configuration:** The module comprises four individually controllable thrusters, each capable of producing a maximum thrust of 1mN. These thrusters are managed through relative thrust control conventions and closed-loop control, allowing precise adjustments to the satellite's orientation and position.

**Payload Accommodation:** In addition to the propulsion system, the satellite can carry an additional payload weighing 0.64kg within a volume of 10cm x 10cm x 7cm.

Overall, the paper aims to provide a detailed framework for integrating a MEMS cold gas thruster-based propulsion system into nanosatellites, enhancing their capability for active orbital control and maneuvering in space.

## Abstract

This paper is based on the nanosatellite orbit mechanism using a cold gas thrust system based on MEMS technology. The project defines the propulsion component appropriate for CubeSat class nanosatellites. The MEMS cold gas propulsion module with 10cm x 10cm x 30cm dimensions and 220g mass is designed specifically for the 2-unit CubeSat class nanosatellite in a 300km low Earth orbit (LEO). The propulsion tank consists of 60g butane under 2 to 5 bar pressure; it can deliver up to 15m/s delta-V capability for a 2.66kg satellite. The propulsion module consists of four individually manageable thrusters with relative thrust control conventions and closed-loop control; 1mN per thruster is the maximum thrust. The satellite with active orbital control is capable of accommodating a 0.64kg of 10cm x 10cm x 7cm additional payload.
